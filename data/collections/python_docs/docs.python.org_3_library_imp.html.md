`imp` â€” Access the import internals
===================================

Deprecated since version 3.4, removed in version 3.12.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.12](../whatsnew/3.12.html#whatsnew312-removed-imp) after
being deprecated in Python 3.4.

The [removal notice](../whatsnew/3.12.html#whatsnew312-removed-imp) includes guidance for
migrating code from `imp` to [`importlib`](importlib.html#module-importlib "importlib: The implementation of the import machinery.").

The last version of Python that provided the `imp` module was
[Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/imp.html).
