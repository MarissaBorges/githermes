Weak Reference Objects
======================

Python supports *weak references* as first-class objects. There are two
specific object types which directly implement weak references. The first is a
simple reference object, and the second acts as a proxy for the original object
as much as it can.

int PyWeakref\_Check([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ob)
:   Return non-zero if *ob* is either a reference or proxy object. This function
    always succeeds.

int PyWeakref\_CheckRef([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ob)
:   Return non-zero if *ob* is a reference object. This function always succeeds.

int PyWeakref\_CheckProxy([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ob)
:   Return non-zero if *ob* is a proxy object. This function always succeeds.

[PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*PyWeakref\_NewRef([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ob, [PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*callback)
:   *Return value: New reference.* *Part of the [Stable ABI](stable.html#stable).*

    Return a weak reference object for the object *ob*. This will always return
    a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an existing
    reference object may be returned. The second parameter, *callback*, can be a
    callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage collected; it
    should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak reference object
    itself. *callback* may also be `None` or `NULL`. If *ob* is not a
    weakly referenceable object, or if *callback* is not callable, `None`, or
    `NULL`, this will return `NULL` and raise [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

[PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*PyWeakref\_NewProxy([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ob, [PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*callback)
:   *Return value: New reference.* *Part of the [Stable ABI](stable.html#stable).*

    Return a weak reference proxy object for the object *ob*. This will always
    return a new reference, but is not guaranteed to create a new object; an
    existing proxy object may be returned. The second parameter, *callback*, can
    be a callable object that receives notification when *ob* is garbage
    collected; it should accept a single parameter, which will be the weak
    reference object itself. *callback* may also be `None` or `NULL`. If *ob*
    is not a weakly referenceable object, or if *callback* is not callable,
    `None`, or `NULL`, this will return `NULL` and raise [`TypeError`](../library/exceptions.html#TypeError "TypeError").

int PyWeakref\_GetRef([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ref, [PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*\*pobj)
:   *Part of the [Stable ABI](stable.html#stable) since version 3.13.*

    Get a [strong reference](../glossary.html#term-strong-reference) to the referenced object from a weak
    reference, *ref*, into *\*pobj*.

    * On success, set *\*pobj* to a new [strong reference](../glossary.html#term-strong-reference) to the
      referenced object and return 1.
    * If the reference is dead, set *\*pobj* to `NULL` and return 0.
    * On error, raise an exception and return -1.

[PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*PyWeakref\_GetObject([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ref)
:   *Return value: Borrowed reference.* *Part of the [Stable ABI](stable.html#stable).*

    Return a [borrowed reference](../glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference) to the referenced object from a weak
    reference, *ref*. If the referent is no longer live, returns `Py_None`.

    Note

    This function returns a [borrowed reference](../glossary.html#term-borrowed-reference) to the referenced object.
    This means that you should always call [`Py_INCREF()`](refcounting.html#c.Py_INCREF "Py_INCREF") on the object
    except when it cannot be destroyed before the last usage of the borrowed
    reference.

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: Use [`PyWeakref_GetRef()`](#c.PyWeakref_GetRef "PyWeakref_GetRef") instead.

[PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*PyWeakref\_GET\_OBJECT([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*ref)
:   *Return value: Borrowed reference.*

    Similar to [`PyWeakref_GetObject()`](#c.PyWeakref_GetObject "PyWeakref_GetObject"), but does no error checking.

    Deprecated since version 3.13, will be removed in version 3.15: Use [`PyWeakref_GetRef()`](#c.PyWeakref_GetRef "PyWeakref_GetRef") instead.

void PyObject\_ClearWeakRefs([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*object)
:   *Part of the [Stable ABI](stable.html#stable).*

    This function is called by the [`tp_dealloc`](typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc "PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc") handler
    to clear weak references.

    This iterates through the weak references for *object* and calls callbacks
    for those references which have one. It returns when all callbacks have
    been attempted.

void PyUnstable\_Object\_ClearWeakRefsNoCallbacks([PyObject](structures.html#c.PyObject "PyObject") \*object)
:   *This is [Unstable API](stable.html#unstable-c-api). It may change without warning in minor releases.*

    Clears the weakrefs for *object* without calling the callbacks.

    This function is called by the [`tp_dealloc`](typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc "PyTypeObject.tp_dealloc") handler
    for types with finalizers (i.e., [`__del__()`](../reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__ "object.__del__")). The handler for
    those objects first calls [`PyObject_ClearWeakRefs()`](#c.PyObject_ClearWeakRefs "PyObject_ClearWeakRefs") to clear weakrefs
    and call their callbacks, then the finalizer, and finally this function to
    clear any weakrefs that may have been created by the finalizer.

    In most circumstances, itâ€™s more appropriate to use
    [`PyObject_ClearWeakRefs()`](#c.PyObject_ClearWeakRefs "PyObject_ClearWeakRefs") to clear weakrefs instead of this function.
