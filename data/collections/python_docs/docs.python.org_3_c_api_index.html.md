Python/C API Reference Manual
=============================

This manual documents the API used by C and C++ programmers who want to write
extension modules or embed Python. It is a companion to [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](../extending/index.html#extending-index),
which describes the general principles of extension writing but does not
document the API functions in detail.
