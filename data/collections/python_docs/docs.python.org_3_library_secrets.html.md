`secrets` â€” Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets
===============================================================

**Source code:** [Lib/secrets.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/secrets.py)

---

The [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module is used for generating cryptographically strong
random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account
authentication, security tokens, and related secrets.

In particular, [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") should be used in preference to the
default pseudo-random number generator in the [`random`](random.html#module-random "random: Generate pseudo-random numbers with various common distributions.") module, which
is designed for modelling and simulation, not security or cryptography.

Random numbers
--------------

The [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module provides access to the most secure source of
randomness that your operating system provides.

*class* secrets.SystemRandom
:   A class for generating random numbers using the highest-quality
    sources provided by the operating system. See
    [`random.SystemRandom`](random.html#random.SystemRandom "random.SystemRandom") for additional details.

secrets.choice(*seq*)
:   Return a randomly chosen element from a non-empty sequence.

secrets.randbelow(*exclusive\_upper\_bound*)
:   Return a random int in the range [0, *exclusive\_upper\_bound*).

secrets.randbits(*k*)
:   Return a non-negative int with *k* random bits.

Generating tokens
-----------------

The [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module provides functions for generating secure
tokens, suitable for applications such as password resets,
hard-to-guess URLs, and similar.

secrets.token\_bytes([*nbytes=None*])
:   Return a random byte string containing *nbytes* number of bytes.
    If *nbytes* is `None` or not supplied, a reasonable default is
    used.

    Copy

    ```
    >>> token_bytes(16)
    b'\xebr\x17D*t\xae\xd4\xe3S\xb6\xe2\xebP1\x8b'

    ```

secrets.token\_hex([*nbytes=None*])
:   Return a random text string, in hexadecimal. The string has *nbytes*
    random bytes, each byte converted to two hex digits. If *nbytes* is
    `None` or not supplied, a reasonable default is used.

    Copy

    ```
    >>> token_hex(16)
    'f9bf78b9a18ce6d46a0cd2b0b86df9da'

    ```

secrets.token\_urlsafe([*nbytes=None*])
:   Return a random URL-safe text string, containing *nbytes* random
    bytes. The text is Base64 encoded, so on average each byte results
    in approximately 1.3 characters. If *nbytes* is `None` or not
    supplied, a reasonable default is used.

    Copy

    ```
    >>> token_urlsafe(16)
    'Drmhze6EPcv0fN_81Bj-nA'

    ```

### How many bytes should tokens use?

To be secure against
[brute-force attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack),
tokens need to have sufficient randomness. Unfortunately, what is
considered sufficient will necessarily increase as computers get more
powerful and able to make more guesses in a shorter period. As of 2015,
it is believed that 32 bytes (256 bits) of randomness is sufficient for
the typical use-case expected for the [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.") module.

For those who want to manage their own token length, you can explicitly
specify how much randomness is used for tokens by giving an [`int`](functions.html#int "int")
argument to the various `token_*` functions. That argument is taken
as the number of bytes of randomness to use.

Otherwise, if no argument is provided, or if the argument is `None`,
the `token_*` functions will use a reasonable default instead.

Note

That default is subject to change at any time, including during
maintenance releases.

Recipes and best practices
--------------------------

This section shows recipes and best practices for using [`secrets`](#module-secrets "secrets: Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets.")
to manage a basic level of security.

Generate an eight-character alphanumeric password:

Copy

```
import string
import secrets
alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
password = ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(8))

```

Note

Applications should not
[**store passwords in a recoverable format**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/257.html),
whether plain text or encrypted. They should be salted and hashed
using a cryptographically strong one-way (irreversible) hash function.

Generate a ten-character alphanumeric password with at least one
lowercase character, at least one uppercase character, and at least
three digits:

Copy

```
import string
import secrets
alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
while True:
    password = ''.join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(10))
    if (any(c.islower() for c in password)
            and any(c.isupper() for c in password)
            and sum(c.isdigit() for c in password) >= 3):
        break

```

Generate an [XKCD-style passphrase](https://xkcd.com/936/):

Copy

```
import secrets
# On standard Linux systems, use a convenient dictionary file.
# Other platforms may need to provide their own word-list.
with open('/usr/share/dict/words') as f:
    words = [word.strip() for word in f]
    password = ' '.join(secrets.choice(words) for i in range(4))

```

Generate a hard-to-guess temporary URL containing a security token
suitable for password recovery applications:

Copy

```
import secrets
url = 'https://example.com/reset=' + secrets.token_urlsafe()

```
