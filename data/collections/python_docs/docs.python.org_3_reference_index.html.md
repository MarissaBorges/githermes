The Python Language Reference
=============================

This reference manual describes the syntax and “core semantics” of the
language. It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete. The semantics of
non-essential built-in object types and of the built-in functions and modules
are described in [The Python Standard Library](../library/index.html#library-index). For an informal introduction to the
language, see [The Python Tutorial](../tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index). For C or C++ programmers, two additional
manuals exist: [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](../extending/index.html#extending-index) describes the high-level picture of how to
write a Python extension module, and the [Python/C API Reference Manual](../c-api/index.html#c-api-index) describes the
interfaces available to C/C++ programmers in detail.
