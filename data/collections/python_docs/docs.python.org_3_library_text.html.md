Text Processing Services
========================

The modules described in this chapter provide a wide range of string
manipulation operations and other text processing services.

The [`codecs`](codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") module described under [Binary Data Services](binary.html#binaryservices) is also
highly relevant to text processing. In addition, see the documentation for
Python’s built-in string type in [Text Sequence Type — str](stdtypes.html#textseq).
