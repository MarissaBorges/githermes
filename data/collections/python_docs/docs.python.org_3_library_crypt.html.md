`crypt` â€” Function to check Unix passwords
==========================================

Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.13](../whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-pep594) after
being deprecated in Python 3.11. The removal was decided in [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/).

Applications can use the [`hashlib`](hashlib.html#module-hashlib "hashlib: Secure hash and message digest algorithms.") module from the standard library.
Other possible replacements are third-party libraries from PyPI:
[legacycrypt](https://pypi.org/project/legacycrypt/), [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/), [argon2-cffi](https://pypi.org/project/argon2-cffi/), or [passlib](https://pypi.org/project/passlib/).
These are not supported or maintained by the Python core team.

The last version of Python that provided the `crypt` module was
[Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/crypt.html).
