How to port Python 2 Code to Python 3
=====================================

Python 2 reached its official end-of-life at the start of 2020. This means
that no new bug reports, fixes, or changes will be made to Python 2 - itâ€™s
no longer supported: see [**PEP 373**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0373/) and
[status of Python versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions).

If you are looking to port an extension module instead of pure Python code,
please see [Porting Extension Modules to Python 3](cporting.html#cporting-howto).

The archived [python-porting](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-porting/) mailing list may contain some useful guidance.

Since Python 3.11 the original porting guide was discontinued.
You can find the old guide in the
[archive](https://docs.python.org/3.10/howto/pyporting.html).
