`email.charset`: Representing character sets
============================================

**Source code:** [Lib/email/charset.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.13/Lib/email/charset.py)

---

This module is part of the legacy (`Compat32`) email API. In the new
API only the aliases table is used.

The remaining text in this section is the original documentation of the module.

This module provides a class [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") for representing character sets
and character set conversions in email messages, as well as a character set
registry and several convenience methods for manipulating this registry.
Instances of [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") are used in several other modules within the
[`email`](email.html#module-email "email: Package supporting the parsing, manipulating, and generating email messages.") package.

Import this class from the [`email.charset`](#module-email.charset "email.charset: Character Sets") module.

*class* email.charset.Charset(*input\_charset=DEFAULT\_CHARSET*)
:   Map character sets to their email properties.

    This class provides information about the requirements imposed on email for a
    specific character set. It also provides convenience routines for converting
    between character sets, given the availability of the applicable codecs. Given
    a character set, it will do its best to provide information on how to use that
    character set in an email message in an RFC-compliant way.

    Certain character sets must be encoded with quoted-printable or base64 when used
    in email headers or bodies. Certain character sets must be converted outright,
    and are not allowed in email.

    Optional *input\_charset* is as described below; it is always coerced to lower
    case. After being alias normalized it is also used as a lookup into the
    registry of character sets to find out the header encoding, body encoding, and
    output conversion codec to be used for the character set. For example, if
    *input\_charset* is `iso-8859-1`, then headers and bodies will be encoded using
    quoted-printable and no output conversion codec is necessary. If
    *input\_charset* is `euc-jp`, then headers will be encoded with base64, bodies
    will not be encoded, but output text will be converted from the `euc-jp`
    character set to the `iso-2022-jp` character set.

    [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") instances have the following data attributes:

    input\_charset
    :   The initial character set specified. Common aliases are converted to
        their *official* email names (e.g. `latin_1` is converted to
        `iso-8859-1`). Defaults to 7-bit `us-ascii`.

    :   If the character set must be encoded before it can be used in an email
        header, this attribute will be set to `charset.QP` (for
        quoted-printable), `charset.BASE64` (for base64 encoding), or
        `charset.SHORTEST` for the shortest of QP or BASE64 encoding. Otherwise,
        it will be `None`.

    body\_encoding
    :   Same as *header\_encoding*, but describes the encoding for the mail
        message’s body, which indeed may be different than the header encoding.
        `charset.SHORTEST` is not allowed for *body\_encoding*.

    output\_charset
    :   Some character sets must be converted before they can be used in email
        headers or bodies. If the *input\_charset* is one of them, this attribute
        will contain the name of the character set output will be converted to.
        Otherwise, it will be `None`.

    input\_codec
    :   The name of the Python codec used to convert the *input\_charset* to
        Unicode. If no conversion codec is necessary, this attribute will be
        `None`.

    output\_codec
    :   The name of the Python codec used to convert Unicode to the
        *output\_charset*. If no conversion codec is necessary, this attribute
        will have the same value as the *input\_codec*.

    [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") instances also have the following methods:

    get\_body\_encoding()
    :   Return the content transfer encoding used for body encoding.

        This is either the string `quoted-printable` or `base64` depending on
        the encoding used, or it is a function, in which case you should call the
        function with a single argument, the Message object being encoded. The
        function should then set the
        header itself to whatever is appropriate.

        Returns the string `quoted-printable` if *body\_encoding* is `QP`,
        returns the string `base64` if *body\_encoding* is `BASE64`, and
        returns the string `7bit` otherwise.

    get\_output\_charset()
    :   Return the output character set.

        This is the *output\_charset* attribute if that is not `None`, otherwise
        it is *input\_charset*.

    :   Header-encode the string *string*.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on the
        *header\_encoding* attribute.

    :   Header-encode a *string* by converting it first to bytes.

        This is similar to [`header_encode()`](#email.charset.Charset.header_encode "email.charset.Charset.header_encode") except that the string is fit
        into maximum line lengths as given by the argument *maxlengths*, which
        must be an iterator: each element returned from this iterator will provide
        the next maximum line length.

    body\_encode(*string*)
    :   Body-encode the string *string*.

        The type of encoding (base64 or quoted-printable) will be based on the
        *body\_encoding* attribute.

    The [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") class also provides a number of methods to support
    standard operations and built-in functions.

    \_\_str\_\_()
    :   Returns *input\_charset* as a string coerced to lower
        case. `__repr__()` is an alias for `__str__()`.

    \_\_eq\_\_(*other*)
    :   This method allows you to compare two [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") instances for
        equality.

    \_\_ne\_\_(*other*)
    :   This method allows you to compare two [`Charset`](#email.charset.Charset "email.charset.Charset") instances for
        inequality.

The [`email.charset`](#module-email.charset "email.charset: Character Sets") module also provides the following functions for adding
new entries to the global character set, alias, and codec registries:

email.charset.add\_charset(*charset*, *header\_enc=None*, *body\_enc=None*, *output\_charset=None*)
:   Add character properties to the global registry.

    *charset* is the input character set, and must be the canonical name of a
    character set.

    Optional *header\_enc* and *body\_enc* is either `charset.QP` for
    quoted-printable, `charset.BASE64` for base64 encoding,
    `charset.SHORTEST` for the shortest of quoted-printable or base64 encoding,
    or `None` for no encoding. `SHORTEST` is only valid for
    *header\_enc*. The default is `None` for no encoding.

    Optional *output\_charset* is the character set that the output should be in.
    Conversions will proceed from input charset, to Unicode, to the output charset
    when the method `Charset.convert()` is called. The default is to output in
    the same character set as the input.

    Both *input\_charset* and *output\_charset* must have Unicode codec entries in the
    module’s character set-to-codec mapping; use [`add_codec()`](#email.charset.add_codec "email.charset.add_codec") to add codecs the
    module does not know about. See the [`codecs`](codecs.html#module-codecs "codecs: Encode and decode data and streams.") module’s documentation for
    more information.

    The global character set registry is kept in the module global dictionary
    `CHARSETS`.

email.charset.add\_alias(*alias*, *canonical*)
:   Add a character set alias. *alias* is the alias name, e.g. `latin-1`.
    *canonical* is the character set’s canonical name, e.g. `iso-8859-1`.

    The global charset alias registry is kept in the module global dictionary
    `ALIASES`.

email.charset.add\_codec(*charset*, *codecname*)
:   Add a codec that map characters in the given character set to and from Unicode.

    *charset* is the canonical name of a character set. *codecname* is the name of a
    Python codec, as appropriate for the second argument to the [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str")’s
    [`encode()`](stdtypes.html#str.encode "str.encode") method.
