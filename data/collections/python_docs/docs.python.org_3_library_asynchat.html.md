`asynchat` â€” Asynchronous socket command/response handler
=========================================================

Deprecated since version 3.6, removed in version 3.12.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.12](../whatsnew/3.12.html#whatsnew312-removed) after
being deprecated in Python 3.6. The removal was decided in [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/).

Applications should use the [`asyncio`](asyncio.html#module-asyncio "asyncio: Asynchronous I/O.") module instead.

The last version of Python that provided the `asynchat` module was
[Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asynchat.html).
