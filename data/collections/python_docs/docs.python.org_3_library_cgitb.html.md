`cgitb` â€” Traceback manager for CGI scripts
===========================================

Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.13](../whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-pep594) after
being deprecated in Python 3.11. The removal was decided in [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/).

A fork of the module on PyPI can now be used instead: [legacy-cgi](https://pypi.org/project/legacy-cgi/).
This is a copy of the cgi module, no longer maintained or supported by the core
Python team.

The last version of Python that provided the `cgitb` module was
[Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/cgitb.html).
