Pack and Unpack functions
-------------------------

The pack and unpack functions provide an efficient platform-independent way to
store floating-point values as byte strings. The Pack routines produce a bytes
string from a C double, and the Unpack routines produce a C
double from such a bytes string. The suffix (2, 4 or 8) specifies the
number of bytes in the bytes string.

On platforms that appear to use IEEE 754 formats these functions work by
copying bits. On other platforms, the 2-byte format is identical to the IEEE
754 binary16 half-precision format, the 4-byte format (32-bit) is identical to
the IEEE 754 binary32 single precision format, and the 8-byte format to the
IEEE 754 binary64 double precision format, although the packing of INFs and
NaNs (if such things exist on the platform) isnâ€™t handled correctly, and
attempting to unpack a bytes string containing an IEEE INF or NaN will raise an
exception.

On non-IEEE platforms with more precision, or larger dynamic range, than IEEE
754 supports, not all values can be packed; on non-IEEE platforms with less
precision, or smaller dynamic range, not all values can be unpacked. What
happens in such cases is partly accidental (alas).

### Pack functions

The pack routines write 2, 4 or 8 bytes, starting at *p*. *le* is an
int argument, non-zero if you want the bytes string in little-endian
format (exponent last, at `p+1`, `p+3`, or `p+6` `p+7`), zero if you
want big-endian format (exponent first, at *p*). The `PY_BIG_ENDIAN`
constant can be used to use the native endian: it is equal to `1` on big
endian processor, or `0` on little endian processor.

Return value: `0` if all is OK, `-1` if error (and an exception is set,
most likely [`OverflowError`](../library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError")).

There are two problems on non-IEEE platforms:

int PyFloat\_Pack2(double x, unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Pack a C double as the IEEE 754 binary16 half-precision format.

int PyFloat\_Pack4(double x, unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Pack a C double as the IEEE 754 binary32 single precision format.

int PyFloat\_Pack8(double x, unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Pack a C double as the IEEE 754 binary64 double precision format.

### Unpack functions

The unpack routines read 2, 4 or 8 bytes, starting at *p*. *le* is an
int argument, non-zero if the bytes string is in little-endian format
(exponent last, at `p+1`, `p+3` or `p+6` and `p+7`), zero if big-endian
(exponent first, at *p*). The `PY_BIG_ENDIAN` constant can be used to
use the native endian: it is equal to `1` on big endian processor, or `0`
on little endian processor.

Return value: The unpacked double. On error, this is `-1.0` and
[`PyErr_Occurred()`](exceptions.html#c.PyErr_Occurred "PyErr_Occurred") is true (and an exception is set, most likely
[`OverflowError`](../library/exceptions.html#OverflowError "OverflowError")).

Note that on a non-IEEE platform this will refuse to unpack a bytes string that
represents a NaN or infinity.

double PyFloat\_Unpack2(const unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Unpack the IEEE 754 binary16 half-precision format as a C double.

double PyFloat\_Unpack4(const unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Unpack the IEEE 754 binary32 single precision format as a C double.

double PyFloat\_Unpack8(const unsigned char \*p, int le)
:   Unpack the IEEE 754 binary64 double precision format as a C double.
