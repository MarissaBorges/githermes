`smtpd` â€” SMTP Server
=====================

Deprecated since version 3.6, removed in version 3.12.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.12](../whatsnew/3.12.html#whatsnew312-removed) after
being deprecated in Python 3.6. The removal was decided in [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/).

A possible replacement is the third-party [aiosmtpd](https://pypi.org/project/aiosmtpd/) library. This
library is not maintained or supported by the Python core team.

The last version of Python that provided the `smtpd` module was
[Python 3.11](https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/smtpd.html).
