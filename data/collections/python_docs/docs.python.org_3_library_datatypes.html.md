Data Types
==========

The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of specialized data
types such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, double-ended
queues, and enumerations.

Python also provides some built-in data types, in particular,
[`dict`](stdtypes.html#dict "dict"), [`list`](stdtypes.html#list "list"), [`set`](stdtypes.html#set "set") and [`frozenset`](stdtypes.html#frozenset "frozenset"), and
[`tuple`](stdtypes.html#tuple "tuple"). The [`str`](stdtypes.html#str "str") class is used to hold
Unicode strings, and the [`bytes`](stdtypes.html#bytes "bytes") and [`bytearray`](stdtypes.html#bytearray "bytearray") classes are used
to hold binary data.

The following modules are documented in this chapter:
