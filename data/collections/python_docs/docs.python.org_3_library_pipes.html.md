`pipes` â€” Interface to shell pipelines
======================================

Deprecated since version 3.11, removed in version 3.13.

This module is no longer part of the Python standard library.
It was [removed in Python 3.13](../whatsnew/3.13.html#whatsnew313-pep594) after
being deprecated in Python 3.11. The removal was decided in [**PEP 594**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/).

Applications should use the [`subprocess`](subprocess.html#module-subprocess "subprocess: Subprocess management.") module instead.

[Python 3.12](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/pipes.html).
